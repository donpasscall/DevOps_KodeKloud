- We can change the VM name in vagrant (further info in vagrant documentation)

NETWORKING PRE-REQ:

-> Switching:
   - Two systems are connected to each other using a switch, and the switch creates a network containing
     the two systems.
   - To connect them to a switch we need an "interface" on each hosts physical or virtual depending on the host.
   - To see the interfaces for the host we use the ip link command.
   - These two form a network with the help of this switch.
   - To add an ip address to that system using the ip addr command 
 
                     ip addr add <ip_address> dev <interface>

-> Routing :
   - Now if we need to connect two networks with each other a router comes into play.
   - A router is just another device in a network, what it means is that how can our packets of information know 
     where even is the router present in this network for inter-network data transfer.
   - That's where we configure a system using a gateway, it is like a door rather than a room(other systems), 
     which acts as a gate to other networks.
   - To see the existing routing configuration on a system, use the route command, it displays the kernel's 
     routing table.
   - we need to add the info using the ip route add command (see image for more detail)
   - ip default gateway : Any network outside of your existing network goes to that particular router.
                          0.0.0.0

- Packets are not forwarded from one interface to the next in linux unless explicitly defined.
- It can be done in a directory by changing the value from 0 to 1.


SUMMARY: 

1. ip link : To list and modifiy interfaces on the host.
2. ip addr : To see the ip addresses assigned to that host.
3. ip addr add : Used to set IP addresses on the interfaces.
4. ip route add <ip1_address> via <ip2_address>
