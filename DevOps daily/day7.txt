APACHE WEV SERVER :

- httpd (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Daemon) is a software program that runs in the background
 of a server and listens for incoming requests from clients on the internet. It is the most
 widely-used web server software, and is the main component of the Apache HTTP Server, which is 
 a free and open-source web server.

- to install httpd service in our host system just use yum install httpd

- Then we can either start or enable to get going.

- Every server has a configuration file where we can configure the different parameters that govern how the 
  server operates such as what port it listens on etc,

- For the APACHE web server it is stored in the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

- Now to access the page hosted by the http server go to port 80 on local host.
  https://localhost:80

- The documentroot defines the location where the static content is stored.

- So moving the static files into this directory, you will see the custom directory. 

- As we know a single apache server can hold multiple websites, to do that the files and configuration of
  each website is configured as virtual hosts within the apache configuration file.
  Thus a virtual host is a division of different websites in a apache webserver. 

- This information can be be mentioned as shown in image (virtualhost).

- Also another important thing is to restart the httpd service after making a change in the config file.

- To make the configuration file small, new configuration can be created (as shown in multipleconfig) and we just need
  to use the include statement in the original configuration file.


APACHE TOMCAT :

- It provides a web server environment where we can host Java-based web applications.

- Apache tomcat server runs on the port 8080.

- Now to deploy a web application on a tomcat server we need to package our code in a WAR package.

- Once the code is packaged move the WAR file into the webapps directory of the server (check tomcatweb)

- Now if the tomcat server is running it automatically detects that an application has ben placed in the webapps 
  directory and the server will extract the war file into a directory in its name.
