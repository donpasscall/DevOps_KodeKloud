DNS:

- We can change name of a system on a network by modifying the files in /etc/hosts directory.
- Whatever name we put in the hostfile for a system is the absolute truth for the other systems in the network.
- They do not check whether the name is correct or not.
- We can have many names we want and for as many servers as we want in the etc/hosts file.
- The Domain Name System is a hierarchical and distributed naming system for computers, services, and other resources 
   in the Internet or other Internet Protocol networks.
- DNS is basically a replacement to the etc/hosts file as we it is very tedious and non-optimal as for every system
  in the network we need to modify the etc/hosts file to specify the names.
- In DNS a single entity in the network holds all the recipient names and ip addresses.
- Every host has a DNS resolution configuration file at etc/resolv.conf. You add an entry into it specifying 
  the address of the DNS server.

             name_server        <ip_address>

- Priority is etc/hosts and then the DNS server. So if there are entries in both the places, etc/hosts one is 
  chosen.
- But that order can also be changed in the etc/nsswitch.conf

-> CONCEPT OF DOMAIN NAMES :
   - Lets take an example:

       www, maps, apps - is the sub-domain                   www.google.com, maps.google.com
       google - is the domain name provided to google
       .com - Top level domain name
        .   - is called the root

  - Let say we want to visit drive.google.com from our organization, our request first hits the organization's 
    DNS server, as it doesn't know who or what drive or google is, so it forwards our request to the internet
    where the ip address of the serer serving drive.google.com may be resolved with the help of multiple DNS 
    servers.

  - LOOk at the search domain image.


NSLOOKUP:	

- This command is used to query a hostname from the DNS server.
- But this doesn't consider the hostfile name in etc/hosts file.
  E.g : nslookup www.google.com
