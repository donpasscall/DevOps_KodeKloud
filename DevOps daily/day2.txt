Lecture 2 :


Virtualisation -

- Type-1 : Installed directly on top of the physical server. E.g : Microsoft Hyper-v
- Type-2 : Layer of host OS that sits between the physical server and the HVs.


NETWORKING IN VIRTUAL BOX: 

- Each VM has 4 adapters.

1. Private Host-only network : 

-> Private network within our PC and the VMs are connected to this network and 
   get addr of the same series, and even our PC gets a new addr(same series).
-> The connectivity is contained within the host which doesn't allow info exchange between different hosts/pc.
-> Internet connectivity is possible with enabling IP forwarding.


2. NAT network: 

-> Network Address Translation Network acts the same way but allows communication with the outer world.
-> NAT engine replaces the source IP with its own IP address, so the outside world will have no idea of the 
   presence of the VMs. This is known as network address translation.
-> No system outside the host cannot access the VMs inside.
-> Internet connectivity is possible.


NAT vs NAT network:

- In NAT the internal network is not present between the VMs of the host, but the individual VMs are able to 
communicate with the outside world.

3. Bridge Network:

-> It is always present unlike host only or NAT.
-> If we want to access the inside VMs or services from outside.
-> The IP address assigned are of the original LAN series. (see image)


PORT FORWARDING:

- It allows us to map a port from the host to the guest.
