YAML:

- YAML is a human-readable data serialization format. It is often used for configuration files, 
  and can be used in a wide variety of programming languages. YAML is designed to be easy for humans 
  to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.
- The key and value is separated by a : (also a space after colon).
- Array/lists and Dictonary/map is shown in (yamlEG)
